+++

Sometimes you need to work with an older version of Terraform but there is no existing Darwin ARM64 binary for the version you need. Even if youâ€™re using version managers like [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), you might find that the correct binary architecture is missing for the version you're looking for. This is common for versions created before Mac processor architecture was released.

Here a quick workaround solution to fix this situation :

1. Install go :

```
brew install go
```

2. Clone the Terraform repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform
```

3. Checkout the required version of Terraform :

```
cd terraform
git checkout tags/v0.12.13
```

4. Build an executable file :

```
go install .
```

5. The previous `go` command build a binary in your `GOBIN` by default. Ensure it is present in your `PATH` :

```
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOBIN)"
```
