title: About

My journey in tech started back in 2013 as a sysadmin, deep in the world of Linux and open-source.
I spent countless hours tinkering with servers, testing new stacks, and automating whatever I could.
At the time, physical servers ruled, and cloud computing was just starting to gain traction but
I could feel a shift coming.

That’s when I realized automation was the future. I started coding to streamline my daily tasks,
long before “DevOps” became the industry buzzword. As infrastructure moved towards code, I embraced new
tools and methodologies to build more scalable, resilient systems.

Today, as a Site Reliability Engineer, I’m still learning, experimenting, and optimizing. This blog is my
space to share insights, lessons, and thoughts on modern infrastructure, automation, and reliability.
